✅ 𝗣𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿: Functional Bimodality in the Brain Networks of Preterm and Term Human Newborns

𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹: Cerebral Cortex, 2014



✅ 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿 #𝟮 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀



1. 𝗠𝗶𝘀𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘀: EEG and fMRI come from different infants, with different pipelines, yet cross-modal conclusions are made. Apples vs. oranges.



2. 𝗢𝗿𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗴𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝘀 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗲-𝗮𝗹𝗹: Zero-lag removal amputates true interactions and introduces artifacts, but the paper treats it as a flawless fix for volume conduction.



3. 𝗔𝗿𝗯𝗶𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗲𝘀: Defining “bimodality” via 5–50% vs. 70–95% cutoffs (ignoring 50–70%) is data-driven slicing with no robustness checks.



4. 𝗪𝗲𝗮𝗸 𝗻𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹: Just 49 time-shift surrogates give poor p-value resolution, then thousands of edges are thresholded on this shaky basis.



5. 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗯𝗶𝗮𝘀: Only five minutes of “artifact-free quiet sleep” are handpicked. That’s clinical cherry-picking, not reproducible science.



6. 𝗦𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗼𝗿-𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝘂𝘁𝘀: With only 25 electrodes, treating sensors as “nodes” ignores neonatal geometry and residual field spread. Source-space was dismissed as “unreliable” yet replaced with speculation.



7. 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝗮𝗻𝗱: Normalizing CC/PL with random shuffles (not degree-preserving) warps baselines. Reported modularity shifts are numerology.



8. 𝗳𝗠𝗥𝗜 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗽𝘀: Global signal regression, smoothing, and heavy censoring wash out amplitude-dependent effects—then the paper triumphantly reports “no bimodality” in fMRI.



9. 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗼–𝗼𝗰𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁—𝗼𝗿 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁? With sparse channels, the “frontal rise in clustering” could just be electrode layout bias.



10. 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵: From tiny EEG snippets and non-comparable fMRI cohorts, the paper leaps to developmental “principles.” Narrative ambition outruns evidence.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁

The idea of amplitude-dependent connectivity is interesting, but the work leans on arbitrary thresholds, weak surrogates, and mismatched modalities. Claims of “functional bimodality” and EEG–fMRI divergence are overstated and inflated by preprocessing choices.



✅ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘁𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆:

• Simultaneous EEG–fMRI on the same infants, preregistered analyses.

• Source-space EEG with neonatal head models; degree-preserving nulls; ≥1000 surrogates.

• Robustness checks across bands, quantiles, and pipelines (no-GSR).

• Larger, unbiased cohorts; report null findings honestly.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Methodologically fragile and overinterpreted; more a hypothesis teaser than solid evidence.
