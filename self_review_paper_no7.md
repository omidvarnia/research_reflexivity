✅ 𝗣𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿: Structural damage in early preterm brain changes the electric resting state networks

𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹: NeuroImage, 2015



✅ 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿 #𝟮 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀



1. 𝗡𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹𝘁𝘆 𝗴𝗮𝗽: While the concept of “electric resting state networks (eRSNs)” is intriguing, the study mostly adapts existing functional connectivity approaches without pushing true methodological boundaries.



2. 𝗦𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁: Only 17 infants (6 with IVH) were analyzed, making statistical power and generalizability questionable.



3. 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿-𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Correlations between graph metrics and neurodevelopmental outcomes are presented as mechanistic links but remain speculative.



4. 𝗟𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝗽𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁: EEG-based scalp nodes were treated as network nodes without robust source modeling, which weakens spatial specificity claims.



5. 𝗕𝗶𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Although noise tests were used, other confounders (like subtle motion or electrode artifacts) were not fully ruled out.



6. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗼𝗿: Multiple comparisons were adjusted, but the risk of type I error remains high given the dense connectivity matrices and exploratory analyses.



7. 𝗢𝘂𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀: Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years are too crude to support strong clinical claims about predictive biomarkers.



8. 𝗧𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Terms like “mechanistic link” and “biomarkers” overstate what is essentially a correlational finding in a pilot dataset.



9. 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲: High preprocessing complexity and multiple parameter choices reduce reproducibility and hinder independent validation.



10. 𝗠𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀: Integration with advanced source modeling or multimodal data (e.g., MRI) could have provided more biologically grounded conclusions.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁

The paper opened an important conversation about early network disruptions in preterm infants, but the claims are stronger than the evidence allows. The findings are hypothesis-generating rather than definitive.



✅ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜’𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘁𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆:

• Increase cohort size and ensure balanced clinical covariates

• Use source-reconstructed EEG or combined EEG–MRI for spatial specificity

• Apply more conservative statistical approaches and preregister analyses

• Frame conclusions more cautiously as exploratory evidence



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Ambitious but preliminary; a foundation, not a final word.
