✅ 𝗣𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿: On the Spatial Distribution of Temporal Complexity in Resting State and Task Functional MRI

𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹: Entropy, 2022



✅ 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿 #𝟮 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀



1. 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗻𝗰𝘆: Comparing Hurst exponent and multiscale entropy mostly shows they produce similar maps, raising doubts about added value.



2. 𝗧𝗮𝘀𝗸 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱: “Task-specific complexity” may be driven by residual design signals or preprocessing artifacts rather than genuine neural changes.



3. 𝗟𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲: Only 100 HCP subjects were used despite >1,000 being available, reducing generalizability.



4. 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗲𝗿 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘀𝗺: SVM results look strong, but separability may be inflated since features were already task-dependent.



5. 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗽: Claims about cognition and intelligence are speculative, not tested here.



6. 𝗡𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝗳𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Graph surrogate testing relies on assumptions that may bias results toward certain patterns.



7. 𝗦𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸: Assuming monofractality ignores possible multifractality in fMRI signals.



8. 𝗦𝗽𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝗺𝗼𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁: A 5 mm kernel risks blurring regional differences in complexity.



9. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸 𝗿𝘂𝗻𝘀: With <300 TRs, task datasets are at the edge of reliable fractal/entropy estimation.



10. 𝗕𝗶𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘃𝘀. 𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹: Alternative explanations (scanner noise, vascular effects) are not ruled out.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁

The study ambitiously revisits temporal complexity in fMRI and applies a graph-based null framework. Yet novelty is modest, assumptions are heavy, and links to cognition are overstated. Findings are intriguing but not definitive.



✅ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘁𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆:

• Use the full HCP dataset for stronger statistics.

• Explore multifractal and multivariate measures, not just univariate indices.

• Benchmark graph surrogates against simpler nulls.

• Tie complexity more directly to behavioral or clinical data.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Methodologically ambitious, interpretatively overstated.
