✅ 𝗣𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿: Automatic detection of generalized paroxysmal fast activity in interictal EEG using time-frequency analysis

𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹: Computers in Biology and Medicine, 2021



✅ 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿 #𝟮 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀



1. 𝗟𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁: Only 13 children with LGS were studied --> too small to generalize findings.



2. 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗮 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱: 12/13 patients were scanned under general anaesthesia, which fundamentally alters EEG dynamics.



3. 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆: Despite being “automatic,” the method still relies on initial manual markup to estimate frequency bands.



4. 𝗕𝗶𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗮𝗹 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: The so-called “bimodal” spectral feature is described broadly (~0.3–3 Hz and 8–20 Hz) but shows large inter-patient variability.



5. 𝗙𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗲 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗯𝘂𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗻: Automatic detection produced far more false positives than true positives, raising doubts about practical clinical utility.



6. 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀: The EEG-fMRI “validation” of false positives is indirect and correlation-based, not ground truth.



7. 𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗱 𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: Detection results are highly sensitive to arbitrary threshold choices, reducing robustness.



8. 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗴𝗮𝗽: Claims of applicability to broader epilepsy syndromes remain speculative, with no supporting data.



9. 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: No demonstration that the method improves patient care, diagnostic accuracy, or treatment outcomes.



10. 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹𝘁𝘆: Builds on well-established time–frequency analysis; the main “contribution” is packaging rather than breakthrough methodology.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁

The paper addresses an important clinical challenge, i.e., objective quantification of GPFA in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The idea of leveraging time-frequency bimodality is appealing, but the heavy reliance on manual priors, high false positive rates, and indirect validation weaken the strength of the claims. The study is a useful step forward but falls short of a robust, deployable solution.



✅ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘁𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆:

• Expand to a larger, independent cohort including non-LGS patients.

• Test in non-anaesthetized EEG-fMRI conditions to avoid confounds.

• Integrate machine learning to reduce manual dependency and adapt to inter-patient variability.

• Provide clinical outcome metrics (diagnostic accuracy, burden estimation, treatment monitoring) to demonstrate real-world impact.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Ambitious idea, limited execution.
