✅ 𝗣𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿: Temporal complexity of fMRI is reproducible and correlates with higher-order cognition

𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹: NeuroImage, 2021



✅ 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿 #𝟮 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀



1. 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗹𝗮𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹𝘁𝘆: The idea of multiscale entropy (MSE) in resting-state fMRI wasn’t new. The work expanded the cohort size but didn’t provide truly new mechanistic insights.



2. 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗿𝗯𝗶𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀: The choice of parameters r=0.5 and m=2 felt ad hoc. No principled justification, no sensitivity analysis beyond descriptive trends.



3. 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗰𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: The “correlation” between temporal complexity and fluid intelligence is weak and observational. Calling it an “important attribute of high-level cognition” is an overreach.



4. 𝗟𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗽𝗵𝘆𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Temporal complexity was treated as a black-box metric without linking it to neurobiology.



5. 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗹𝗱: Intra-class correlations were “good” in some networks, but variability in subcortical regions and at coarser scales was glossed over.



6. 𝗠𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗱: Head motion has lower complexity, but residual motion artifacts may still bias the results.



7. 𝗗𝗼𝘄𝗻𝘀𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 𝘀𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄: The TR sensitivity analysis was superficial—no exploration of noise amplification or denoising strategies.



8. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗱: The analysis assumed independence across regions when calculating effect sizes and permutation statistics, despite clear spatial and temporal dependencies in the data.



9. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗯𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀: Brain networks are inherently multivariate, yet the analysis reduced them to univariate entropy curves, ignoring cross-network dynamics.



10. 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸: With nearly a thousand subjects, “statistical significance” was inevitable, but practical effect sizes were modest.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁

Ambitious dataset, clean execution, and reproducibility testing were strengths. But the interpretation inflated the findings, and the link to cognition remains speculative rather than conclusive.



✅ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜’𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘁𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆:

• Use principled Bayesian models for parameter selection and uncertainty quantification.

• Incorporate multivariate or graph-based entropy metrics.

• Rigorously model head-motion artifacts and physiological noise.

• Frame the cognitive associations as exploratory, not confirmatory.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Robust analysis, but interpretative overreach and methodological blind spots.
