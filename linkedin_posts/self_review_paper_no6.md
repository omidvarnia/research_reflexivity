✅ 𝗣𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿: A time–frequency based approach for generalized phase synchrony assessment in nonstationary multivariate signals

𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹: Digital Signal Processing, 2013



✅ 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿 #𝟮 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀



1. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁 𝗥𝗲𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴: The method builds on established IF and cointegration theory but sometimes rebrands existing concepts as “novel.”



2. 𝗦𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗟𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: The validation on simulated data is convincing, but the neonatal EEG dataset (just five subjects) is too small for meaningful statistical generalization.



3. 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗲𝘀: The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) choice is sensible but unoptimized; noise sensitivity and mode-mixing issues are not addressed.



4. 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰 𝗪𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀: Performance metrics (AUC, sensitivity/specificity) are reported but lack confidence intervals or robustness checks across varying conditions.



5. 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗚𝗮𝗽: The discussion of irrational phase relationships is intriguing but mathematically shallow: no strong theoretical framework supports those claims.



6. 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: Real-world clinical utility is overstated; results show moderate discriminative power (AUC ≤ 0.75) for seizure detection.



7. 𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿𝗻: The method’s computational cost and scalability are glossed over; applying this to long-term or high-density EEG would be challenging.



8. 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸 𝗢𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻: Alternative IF estimation techniques, such as adaptive synchrosqueezing or multitaper methods, are not benchmarked.



9. 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝗶𝗺: The interpretation of persistent inter-hemispheric connectivity in non-seizure EEG is speculative without corroborating imaging or physiological evidence.



10. 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗚𝗮𝗽: The paper lacks a reproducibility package: no code, no data, making independent validation impossible.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁

The concept is innovative, but its execution is still preliminary. The idea of generalized phase synchrony in nonstationary signals is valuable, but the implementation and evidence fall short of the strong claims made.



✅ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜’𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘁𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆:

• Use larger, more diverse datasets to validate findings.

• Include modern decomposition techniques to handle noise and nonlinearity.

• Release code and data to ensure reproducibility.

• Provide a clearer theoretical basis for “irrational” synchrony and its physiological relevance.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆:

This is a promising but early-stage contribution: an interesting conceptual foundation but limited practical application.
