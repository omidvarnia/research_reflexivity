✅ 𝗣𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿: Dynamic coupling between fMRI local connectivity and interictal EEG in focal epilepsy: A wavelet analysis approach

✅ 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿 #𝟮 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀



1. 𝗡𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱: the framework builds on existing DRePS and BAF concepts, yet is presented as if entirely new.



2. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝗶𝘇𝗲 (7 patients) is too small to support generalization or clinical translation.



3. 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝘃𝘆 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗽 𝗘𝗘𝗚 introduces ambiguity; without intracranial EEG, true source localization remains speculative.



4. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱 𝗱𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝗜𝗘𝗗𝘀 at a “dominant” electrode, an inherently subjective choice that biases results.



5. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗚𝗟𝗠-𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗘𝗘𝗚-𝗳𝗠𝗥𝗜 are limited; the lack of overlap is described but not systematically explained.



6. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝘀 𝘄𝗲𝗮𝗸: results are interpreted via plausibility rather than validated against ground truth.



7. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗯𝘀𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗻𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 𝗼𝗿 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 makes it impossible to assess whether observed DRePS–BAF coupling is specific or artifactual.



8. 𝗧𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 issues between EEG spikes and fMRI BOLD responses are acknowledged but not solved.



9. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝗶𝗺 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗗𝗥𝗲𝗣𝗦–𝗕𝗔𝗙 𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 “𝗲𝗽𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗻𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀” rather than onset zones is intriguing, yet unsubstantiated by outcome data.



10. 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 is hinted at but not convincingly demonstrated; no correlation with surgical success or long-term outcomes.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁

The study is conceptually interesting and demonstrates a technically sophisticated coupling framework. However, methodological weaknesses—small cohort, subjectivity in EEG selection, lack of validation—mean that the conclusions remain preliminary. The paper opens a path but falls short of establishing robustness or clinical impact.



✅ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜’𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘁𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆:

• Incorporate larger, homogeneous cohorts with consistent epilepsy syndromes.

• Use intracranial EEG or advanced source localization to mitigate scalp ambiguities.

• Employ simulations and null models for objective validation of coupling results.

• Link findings to clinical outcomes (e.g., surgical resection success) for translational relevance.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Promising concept, weak evidence.
