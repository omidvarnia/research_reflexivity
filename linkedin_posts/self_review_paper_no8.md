✅ 𝗣𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿: Towards fast and reliable simultaneous EEG-fMRI analysis of epilepsy with automatic spike detection

𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹: Clinical Neurophysiology, 2019



✅ 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿 #𝟮 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀



1. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁 𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹𝘁𝘆: While the matched-filter approach is elegantly applied, it is conceptually a classical technique.



2. 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗴𝗮𝗽: The study lacks strong clinical validation, as few patients underwent surgery to confirm the epileptogenic zones suggested by the algorithm.



3. 𝗦𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝗶𝘇𝗲: Only 16 patients (19 datasets) is a modest cohort, limiting generalizability across heterogeneous epilepsy types.



4. 𝗧𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗯𝗶𝗮𝘀: The requirement of a clean template derived from manual markup reduces “automation” and may bias detection toward more obvious spikes.



5. 𝗡𝗼𝗶𝘀𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝘀𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: The method assumes spike consistency; variable morphologies or noisy EEG channels could degrade performance, but this limitation isn’t rigorously quantified.



6. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Multiple-comparison corrections were applied, but the link between stronger statistical power and actual clinical benefit remains insufficiently substantiated.



7. 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Although the paper promotes clinical utility, there is no workflow demonstration in a real clinical pipeline or cost–benefit analysis.



8. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝗴𝗮𝗽: Benchmarking against more advanced machine learning methods (e.g., deep learning or multichannel models) is missing, leaving unclear where this method truly stands.



9. 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: The conclusion that the method is “fast, reliable, and easy to use” seems premature given the absence of prospective clinical trials.



10. 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸: In cases where additional “activated regions” were detected, the biological plausibility is assumed but not rigorously cross-validated, risking overinterpretation.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁

The study makes a contribution toward reducing the manual burden of EEG markup in EEG-fMRI. However, the evidence is exploratory, and clinical claims outpace the available validation.



✅ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘁𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆:

• Include larger, more diverse patient cohorts with multi-center data.

• Validate results against surgical outcomes or invasive recordings for ground truth.

• Benchmark performance against modern deep learning or multichannel methods.

• Quantify false positives and establish statistical corrections for robust interpretation.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: A proof-of-concept but not yet a clinically mature solution.
