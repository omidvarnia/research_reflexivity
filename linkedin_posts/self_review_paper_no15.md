✅ 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿 #𝟮 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀



1. 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗠𝗟 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗶𝗰𝗲: The analysis relies on very basic linear models (ridge regression, SVM) which are far behind the state of the art. In the deep learning era, this feels preliminary and inadequate for real applications.



2. 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲: The “finding” that demographics outperform fMRI is trivial and already well-documented. The research question itself was poorly motivated.



3. 𝗪𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲𝘀: Running tens of thousands of computationally intensive models on 20,000 subjects to confirm the obvious is hard to justify.



4. 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹𝘁𝘆: The paper frames its results as new insights, but prior studies had reached the same conclusion years earlier.



5. 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲: Even with a massive dataset, correlations remain <0.25. These effect sizes are not actionable.



6. 𝗕𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗹𝗮𝘄𝗲𝗱: UK Biobank’s cognitive tests are unreliable; using them as primary outcomes undermines validity.



7. 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗲𝗮𝗸: Temporal complexity measures (wPE, RangeEnB) are highlighted, but their cognitive relevance is barely explained.



8. 𝗡𝗼𝗶𝘀𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗼𝘅: Claiming predictive information in low-tSNR regions raises suspicion of artifact leakage.



9. 𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲 𝗻𝗮𝗿𝗿𝗼𝘄: Excluding subcortical/cerebellar regions makes “whole-brain” claims untenable.



10. 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝗶𝗺𝘀: The leap to “personalized medicine” is unjustified given the trivial effect sizes.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁

This paper illustrates how big data can be squandered on an unoriginal, low-yield question. The conclusion was obvious from the beginning: demographics outperform rsfMRI. Overselling weak and incremental findings as groundbreaking makes the work look like a complete waste of time, energy, and computational resources.



✅ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘁𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆:

• First, I would conduct a basic literature review and immediately recognize that this research question has already received an answer.

• I would not invest time, energy, and supercomputing resources on a trivial confirmation study.

• I would design a study with true novelty, e.g., testing unexplored mechanisms or integrating modalities.

• I would frame any contribution modestly rather than overselling incremental, predictable results.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: A misallocation of effort.
