✅ 𝗣𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿: Hierarchical disruption in the Bayesian brain: Focal epilepsy and brain networks

𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹: NeuroImage: Clinical, 2017



✅ 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿 #𝟮 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀



1. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝘃𝗮𝗴𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀: Ambitiously applies the free-energy principle to epilepsy, but the argument reads more like speculation than testable science.



2. 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻: Predictive coding and Bayesian brain theories are borrowed wholesale, without tailoring rigorously to epilepsy mechanisms.



3. 𝗟𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮: Marketed as an “opinion paper,” but the absence of empirical validation makes claims precarious. At best, these claims are mere hypotheses; at worst, they represent overpromises.



4. 𝗧𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Phrases like “excessive surprise in the Bayesian brain” are catchy but lack operational definition, limiting utility.



5. 𝗗𝗖𝗠 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: Suggesting dynamic causal modelling is plausible, but limitations (simplified models, no laminar specificity) are glossed over.



6. 𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗰𝗶𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: The work leans heavily on the predictive coding canon, while alternatives for epileptic network dysfunction are sidelined.



7. 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: Potential therapies (CBT, neuromodulation, stimulation) are named, but no real pathway is mapped toward clinical testing.



8. 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Implies common mechanisms across focal epilepsies without distinguishing subtypes.



9. 𝗙𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗲𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: By unifying functional connectivity, effective connectivity, and free energy, it risks confusing rather than clarifying.



10. 𝗨𝗻𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹𝘁𝘆: Contribution beyond reframing known epilepsy connectivity findings in Bayesian terms is not evident.



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁

Bold in ambition, introducing free energy as a lens on focal epilepsy, but weak in empirical grounding. Claims stay more metaphorical than mechanistic, stimulating to read but difficult to operationalize.



✅ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗱𝗼 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘁𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆:

• Provide empirical evidence or simulations, not just theory

• Define measurable biomarkers tied to “precision” or “prediction error”

• Compare free-energy framing with alternative mechanistic models

• Outline a clear experimental pipeline (hypothesis → DCM → clinical use)



✅ 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Philosophically ambitious, scientifically under-anchored.
